# Path-Planing-Algorithm
-	A 2D Environment was provided where a Robot needs to find the shortest Path to travel from Start Location S to the Goal Location G.
-	Obstacles and Empty Locations are present in the environment 
-	Robot can only move in Empty Locations and 4 Directions which are Left, Right, Up, Down.
-	Robot needs to decide which way to move based on shortest Distance Travelled and Manhattan Distance.
-	After Reaching to the Goal, it needs to traverse the shortest path (put directions) taken by him to reach from Start to Goal Location.

Test Cases are present in testCases folder where I have provided different Maze to find the shortest path (from S to G) and provided expected output and actual output files.
